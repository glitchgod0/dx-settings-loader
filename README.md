* Restart RPCS3 if you've already opened it and click on DXSL in the list.

## Use

DXSL use is very straightforward. Each game has it's own subsection to which you can change it's individual settings in conjunction with the universal settings.
The settings available for change in DXSL are the same as the settings available to you in each respective game.
Change each setting as you wish and once done, hit the **[SAVE SETTINGS]** button near the top of the main menu.
